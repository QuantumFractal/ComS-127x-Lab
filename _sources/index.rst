Section 1: Introduction
:::::::::::::::::::::::

Welcome to our new shiny lab system. This system is intended to teach you how to do Python interactively. We're going to use some cool drop-ins, you've seen the professor program up on the projector in class. Now you can try it within this page!


.. activecode:: PrintingAList
   :coach:

   print("My first program adds a list of numbers")
   print(total)

After hitting run, try clicking ``Show CodeLens`` and you'll see a step through of the program. Basically, we'll write a bit about what we want you to learn, you can try some examples, then you'll be asked to complete a check point by opening up your Wings101 editor and typing out the solution to a problem.
